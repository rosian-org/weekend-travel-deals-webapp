18 Feb 2019:
- Logo at navbar linked to Rosian.org
- Hamburger icon replaced with Filter icon as the related panel contains only filters.
- Filter section received a "Done" button for breakpoints smaller than LG. This allows easier closing the panel once user finished with filtering
- The background colour of the deal cards is lighter than the filters. This is a visual guide for the user for the two seperate section of the page.
- Added "Remove all filters" button when the Overfiltering event happens.
- Price breakdown displayed on the buttons (prices for flight and accommodation, not just the overall)
- Budget filter received more intuitive labels: price ranges (numbers).
